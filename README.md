# VibeOS

VibeOS implements KFS (Kernel From Scratch) subjects while intentionally excluding direct code editing, comprehension, or debugging. This design choice aligns strictly with the philosophy expressed in [this tweet by Andrej Karpathy](https://x.com/karpathy/status/1886192184808149383).

Even this README was written using prompting â€” staying true to the principle of leveraging AI to write code and documentation from natural language.
